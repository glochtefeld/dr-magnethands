# Dr. Magnethands
A version of the tabletop game [Doctor Magnethands](https://lookrobot.co.uk/doctor-magnethands/) created with the Unity engine. 

## What is Doctor Magnethands?

To quote [Grant Howitt](https://twitter.com/gshowitt), Doctor Magnethands is a game where you play superheroes looking to save the world from destruction by stopping the devious Doctor Magnethands from firing his rocket-powered radioactive castle on the moon into the White House on CHRISTMAS EVE.

It is a fantastically fun game for as many drunk people you can corral into the same room. The point is to make other people laugh by creating the most ridiculous superheroes possible.  

However, the global pandemic is currently preventing sensible people from gathering, even drunk ones. Thanks to Dr. Magnethands (the video game, hereafter referred to as Dr. Magnethands), you can now play this tabletop game as if you were at the same table! 

Dr. Magnethands works best with a VoIP app like [Discord](https://www.discordapp.com) and a virtual LAN port like [ZeroTier One](https://www.zerotier.com/). That way, any LAN games will automatically show up in the LAN server list, even if all players aren't on the same LAN.

## Features

* LAN Co-op multiplayer, up to 8 players
* Direct Connection co-op multiplayer, up to 8 players 

## Installation

See the [Releases tab](https://www.github.com/glochtefeld/dr-magnethands/releases) for the latest download. Download the zip file and install it in any folder of your choice, for example `C:\Games`. You can then create a shortcut to `Dr. Magnethands.exe` onto your desktop or into a game launcher of your choice. Afterwards, it would be a good idea for everyone to read [the actual rules to the tabletop version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/swrsabebae8ydem/Doctor%20Magnethands.pdf), since this early version of the game requires some familiarity. If you prefer not to install a virtual LAN port like ZeroTier One, you will need to open port 42000 on your router.

## Uninstallation

As Dr. Magnethands is a portable application, you can just delete the installation folder.
